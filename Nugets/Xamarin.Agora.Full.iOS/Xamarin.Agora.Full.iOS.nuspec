    <releaseNotes>
v2.1.3 (Released Apr 19th, 2018)
In v2.1.3 Agora has updated the bitrate values of the setVideoProfile API in the live-broadcast mode. The bitrate values in v2.1.3 stay consistent with those in v2.0. For more information, see descriptions on setVideoProfile in Interactive Broadcast API .

Issues Fixed
Fixed the issue that the Block callbacks were occasionally not received if the delegate has not been set.
Fixed the issue that NSAssertionHandler appears in the external links to SDK.
Fixed the issue of occasional recording failure on some phones when the user leaves the channel and turns on the in-built recording device.
Fixed the issue that in live-broadcast mode the iOS client cannot see the video from the Web client on Win 10 even after the iOS has called enableWebSdkInteroperability.
Fixed the issue of occasional resolution change after it uses UIImagePickerController to enable the system camera and switches back to the live broadcast.
Fixed the issue of occasional crash during a communication or live-broadcast session.

Improvements
Improved the performance of screen sharing by shortening the time interval between which users switch from screen sharing to normal communication or live-broadcast.
